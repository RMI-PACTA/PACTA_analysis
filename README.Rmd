The main goal of PACTA_analysis is to run
[PACTA](https://2degrees-investing.org/resource/pacta/).

## Usage

From a terminal (e.g. bash) running PACTA involves three steps:

1. Clone the private data and the public source code from GitHub, and work from the
the experimental branch where we're "dockerizing" PACTA.
  
```bash
git clone git@github.com:2DegreesInvesting/pacta-data.git  # Private data!
git clone git@github.com:2DegreesInvesting/PACTA_analysis -b 478-add_vanilla_pacta_dockerfile
cd PACTA_analysis
```

2. Setup  directories for inputs and outputs (io):

* Create input/ and output/ directories, as siblings of your working directory

* Populate the input directory with a portfolio file like
[TestPortfolio_Input.csv](https://github.com/jdhoffa/PACTA_analysis/blob/add_basic_dockerfile/working_dir/20_Raw_Inputs/TestPortfolio_Input.csv),
and a parameters file like
[TestPortfolio_Input_PortfolioParameters.yml](https://github.com/jdhoffa/PACTA_analysis/blob/add_basic_dockerfile/working_dir/20_Raw_Inputs/TestPortfolio_Input.csv)
(here we use some test files).

```bash
./bin/setup-io
```

3. Run PACTA via [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

```bash
docker-compose up
```

<details>

You may interact with the PACTA container with:

```bash
docker-compose run app bash
```

These are the files used to create the Docker image and run the container:

```{r engine="bash", comment=""}
cat Dockerfile
```

```{r engine="bash", comment=""}
cat docker-compose.yml
```

```{r engine="bash", comment=""}
cat docker-compose.override.yml
```

</details>

You may remove the input/ and output/ directories and start again.

```bash
rm ../input ../output -ri
```
